# Smart-fire-alarm-system
This project is a smart fire alarm that utilizes machine learning algorithms to improve the efficiency and accuracy of fire detection. The project combines hardware and software components to create a reliable and intelligent fire detection system.

Hardware Components
The hardware component of the project includes:

Temperature sensor
Humidity sensor
Smoke sensor
Microcontroller (e.g. Arduino or Raspberry Pi)
The sensors are connected to the microcontroller, which processes the data collected from the sensors and sends alerts to the user when a potential fire hazard is detected.

Software Components
The software component of the project includes:

Machine learning algorithms
Code for data processing and analysis
Code for sending alerts and notifications
The machine learning model has been trained on a large dataset of fire-related data to accurately identify the patterns and indicators of a fire. The code for data processing and analysis is used to process the data collected by the sensors and feed it into the machine learning model. The code for sending alerts and notifications is used to notify the user when a fire hazard is detected.

Usage
To use this project, you will need to assemble the hardware components and upload the software code to the microcontroller. The code can be modified to suit your specific hardware setup and notification preferences.

Requirements
Arduino or Raspberry Pi microcontroller
Temperature sensor
Humidity sensor
Smoke sensor
Jupyter Notebook or Python environment to run the machine learning algorithms
